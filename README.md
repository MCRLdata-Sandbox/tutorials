Tutorials explaining how to interact with Github, R, MCRLdata, and much more. 

üèñÔ∏è Note: If this is <ins>your first time here</ins>, or you have questions about the whys, whats, and hows, please start with the **[sandbox_intro](https://github.com/MCRLdata-Sandbox/.github/blob/main/sandbox_intro.md)**

Prior to working with these codes, you'll need to do 2 things (minimum):

  1. Install R - see https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html
  2. Install RStudio - see https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html

Once those steps are complete, the easiest way to run a script (e.g., .R files located in scripts folder on this repo) is to download it to your local then open it in RStudio:  https://github.com/MCRLdata-Sandbox/tutorials/blob/main/Download_and_open_an_R_script.pdf

  3. Create a Github account - https://github.com/join
  4. Install Github Desktop - (unless you're a pro and prefer to interact via command-line interface. I'm not, and use Github Desktop) - https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop

Tutorial scripts are ordered approximately by complexity, starting with the bare basics of R. All tutorial scripts are either R code files (.R) or R markdown files and located in the /scripts folder

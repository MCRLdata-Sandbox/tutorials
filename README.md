Tutorials explaining how to interact with Github, R, MCRLdata, and much more. 

Prior to working with these codes, you'll need to do 4 things:

Install R - see https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html
Install RStudio - see https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html
Create a Github account - https://github.com/join
Install Github Desktop - (unless you're a pro and prefer to interact via command-line interface. I'm not, and use Github Desktop) - https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop
All scripts are ordered, and located in the /scripts folder

Tutorials explaining how to interact with Github, R, MCRLdata, and much more. 

Prior to working with these codes, you'll need to do 4 things:

  1. Install R - see https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html
  2. Install RStudio - see https://rstudio-education.github.io/hopr/starting.html
  3. Create a Github account - https://github.com/join
  4. Install Github Desktop - (unless you're a pro and prefer to interact via command-line interface. I'm not, and use Github Desktop) - https://docs.github.com/en/desktop/installing-and-configuring-github-desktop/installing-and-authenticating-to-github-desktop/installing-github-desktop

Tutorial scripts are ordered approximately by complexity, starting with the bare basics of R. All tutorial scripts are either R code files (.R) or R markdown files and located in the /scripts folder
